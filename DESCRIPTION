Description: Converts R data frames and 'sf' spatial objects into 'JSON' and 
    'GeoJSON' strings. The core encoders are implemented in 'Rust' using the 
    'extendr' framework and are designed to efficiently serialize large 
    tabular and spatial datasets. Returns serialized 'JSON' text, allowing 
    applications such as 'shiny' or web APIs to transfer data to 
    client-side 'JavaScript' libraries without additional encoding overhead.
