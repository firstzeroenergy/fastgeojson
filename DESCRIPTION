Title: High-Performance GeoJSON and JSON Serialization for R
Version: 0.1.1
Authors@R: person(given = "Alex", family = "Jorion", role = c("aut", "cre"), email = "alex.jorion@firstzeroenergy.com")
Description: Converts R data frames and 'sf' spatial objects into JSON and 
    GeoJSON strings. The core encoders are implemented in Rust using the 
    'extendr' framework and are designed to efficiently serialize large 
    tabular and spatial datasets. Returns serialized JSON text, allowing 
    applications such as 'shiny' or web APIs to transfer data to 
    client-side JavaScript libraries without additional encoding overhead.
