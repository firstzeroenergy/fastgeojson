Description: A high-performance 'JSON' encoder implemented in 'Rust'. It includes a 
    universal 'as_json()' function capable of serializing most R objects -- 
    including 'sf' spatial data, data frames, and nested lists. It acts as a 
    parallelized alternative to 'jsonlite' and includes tools to seamlessly 
    inject high-performance serialization into existing web frameworks like 
    'Shiny', 'Leaflet', and 'Highcharter'.
