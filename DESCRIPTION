Description: A high-performance JSON encoder implemented in Rust. It includes a 
    universal 'as_json()' function capable of serializing most R objects -- 
    including 'sf' spatial data, data frames, and nested lists -- often acting 
    as a drop-in, parallelized alternative to 'jsonlite'. Designed to minimize 
    latency in 'shiny' apps and web APIs by maximizing memory bandwidth and CPU 
    utilization.
