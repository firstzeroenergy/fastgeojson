\## Resubmission

This is a resubmission. In this version, I have addressed the following feedback:



\* Removed redundant "for R" from the Title in DESCRIPTION.

\* Added single quotes around software names (e.g., 'JSON', 'Rust', 'sf') in both DESCRIPTION and documentation.

\* Added \\value{} sections to the .Rd documentation for exported functions to describe return values and classes.



\## Test environments

\* local Windows 11 install, R 4.5.2

\* R-universe (Ubuntu 22.04, Windows Server 2022, macOS Sequoia)

\* win-builder (devel and release)

\* R-hub (macOS-arm64, Ubuntu-latest)

\* GitHub Actions (macos-latest, ubuntu-latest, windows-latest)



\## R CMD check results
